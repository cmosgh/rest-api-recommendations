### Keep JSON minified in all responses

Extra whitespace adds needless response size to requests, and many
clients for human consumption will automatically "prettify" JSON
output. It is best to keep JSON responses minified e.g.:

```json
{"beta":false,"email":"alice@heroku.com","id":"01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef","last_login":"2012-01-01T12:00:00Z","created_at":"2012-01-01T12:00:00Z","updated_at":"2012-01-01T12:00:00Z"}
```

Instead of e.g.:

```json
{
  "beta": false,
  "email": "alice@heroku.com",
  "id": "01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef",
  "last_login": "2012-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "created_at": "2012-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2012-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

You should consider providing a way for clients to retrieve
a formatted response, through a query parameter (e.g. `?pretty=true`)
